Description: This package contains all of the top 4 Tier English soccer results from 1888/9 Season to the 2013/4 Season.
             Results for the truncated 1939/40 season are included, as are for those games by teams that dropped out during
             the season (1919/20 Leeds City, 1931/32 Wigan Borough, 1961/62 Accrington Stanley) or joined in the middle of
             a season (1919/20 Port Vale).  Team names are kept uniform throughout (e.g. Ardwick are referred to as 
             Manchester City).  Relocated teams are considered to have separate teamnames (e.g. Wimbledon-MK Dons; 
             South Shields - Gateshead).   
             
             The main dataset is 'engsoccerdata2'.   
             
             Future versions of this package will contain cup competition results and 
             results from other European and World Leagues.
